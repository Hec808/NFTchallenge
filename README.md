## My process

When I saw the challenge, I decided that using a Front-end framework was very excesive, so I decided to use only scss, css & html to work on the project.

First, I defined all the scss variables that were going to be used.
Second, I gave the different parts of the project its IDs.
Third, I started writing the css properties so that the project looked like the example.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Scss

### What I learned

This challenge was a very usefull one because it helped me refresh the usage of SCSS and other CSS properties.
